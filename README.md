 Creating an AI-driven platform that fetches data from social media platforms like Instagram, analyzes user reviews, and helps brands increase their ROI (Return on Investment) involves several key components, including API integrations, data analytics, and AI models. This requires knowledge of both backend development (to connect with APIs and process data) and machine learning (for ROI optimization). Below are the steps and Python code snippets for implementing each of the requested features.
Key Features Overview:

    Instagram User Data Fetching & Matching: Fetch data of users who register on your website from Instagram using Instagram APIs (via Instagram Graph API or Instagram Basic Display API), and match the best-fit users for the brands based on specific requirements.

    AI Method to Increase ROI for Brands: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, interactions, and historical data to recommend strategies for brands to increase their ROI.

    Displaying Reviews & Ratings: Scrape and display product reviews from platforms like Amazon and Walmart on the brand’s site.

    Calculating ROI Increase: Use AI models and data analysis to calculate and track the ROI increase based on user engagement, product reviews, and social media data.

1. Instagram User Data Fetching and Matching with Brand's Requirements

To access Instagram data, you'll need to use the Instagram Graph API or Basic Display API. The Graph API allows you to access user data once the user has logged in and granted permission to access their data.
Step 1: Setting Up Instagram API

To use the Instagram Graph API:

    Go to the Facebook Developer Portal.
    Create an App and set up Instagram Basic Display.
    Get the App ID and App Secret and set up the necessary OAuth flow to authenticate users.

Once you have authenticated the users, you can fetch data like their profile, followers, posts, and more. This can be useful to match users with a brand’s requirements.

import requests

# Constants - Replace with your actual App credentials
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'user_access_token'  # Access Token received after Instagram OAuth
INSTAGRAM_API_URL = 'https://graph.instagram.com/me'
FIELDS = 'id,username,media_count,account_type,followers_count,follows_count'

# Fetch Instagram user data
def get_instagram_data():
    url = f"{INSTAGRAM_API_URL}?fields={FIELDS}&access_token={ACCESS_TOKEN}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

# Example of fetching data
user_data = get_instagram_data()
if user_data:
    print(user_data)  # Contains Instagram user info such as followers, media count

Step 2: Matching Users with Brand Requirements

Once you have access to Instagram user data (e.g., number of followers, engagement rate, interests), you can create an algorithm that matches users to brands based on the brand’s requirements (e.g., number of followers, specific demographics, etc.).

For example, if a brand wants to find users with more than 10,000 followers:

def match_user_to_brand(user_data, brand_requirements):
    matched_users = []
    
    for user in user_data:
        if user['followers_count'] >= brand_requirements['min_followers']:
            matched_users.append(user)
    
    return matched_users

# Define brand requirements
brand_requirements = {
    'min_followers': 10000  # Brand wants users with at least 10,000 followers
}

# Example: Matching users
matched_users = match_user_to_brand([user_data], brand_requirements)
print(matched_users)

2. AI Method to Help Brands Increase ROI

Increasing ROI can involve various strategies such as optimizing ad spend, targeting the right audience, improving product engagement, and increasing conversion rates. You can use predictive analytics and machine learning models to analyze historical data and recommend strategies for improving ROI.
Step 1: AI Model for ROI Prediction

You can build a regression model to predict ROI based on different factors like user engagement, ad spend, and user demographics.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Example data (You would collect this from your brand's data)
data = {
    'ad_spend': [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000],
    'user_engagement': [500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500],
    'click_through_rate': [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3],
    'roi': [5, 10, 12, 15, 18]  # Example ROI values
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split the data into features and target
X = df[['ad_spend', 'user_engagement', 'click_through_rate']]
y = df['roi']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a simple regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict ROI on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Predict ROI for new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame([[6000, 3000, 0.35]], columns=['ad_spend', 'user_engagement', 'click_through_rate'])
predicted_roi = model.predict(new_data)
print(f'Predicted ROI: {predicted_roi[0]}')

Step 2: Optimizing Ad Spend and Engagement

You could build optimization algorithms (like gradient descent) to maximize ROI, or integrate A/B testing to find the most effective strategies.
3. Display Reviews and Ratings from Amazon/Walmart

To display reviews and ratings from Amazon and Walmart, you can either scrape data using web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup (if allowed by the website) or use official APIs, if available. Here's an example using BeautifulSoup to scrape product reviews from Amazon.
Example: Scraping Reviews from Amazon (Assuming it's allowed by Amazon's Terms of Service)

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Function to fetch Amazon reviews for a product
def get_amazon_reviews(product_url):
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36"
    }
    response = requests.get(product_url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        reviews = []
        
        # Extract reviews (Note: this will depend on the page structure)
        review_elements = soup.find_all('span', {'data-asin': True})
        for review in review_elements:
            review_text = review.get_text(strip=True)
            reviews.append(review_text)
        
        return reviews
    else:
        return None

# Example usage
product_url = 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y7LZ7F3'
reviews = get_amazon_reviews(product_url)
print(reviews)

For Walmart, you can follow a similar process but with their specific HTML structure.
4. Calculating ROI Increase for the Brand

To track the increase in ROI for a brand after implementing a new strategy, you can track changes in sales, engagement, and ad spend before and after the strategy.

# Example: Tracking ROI increase
def track_roi_increase(before_data, after_data):
    before_roi = before_data['roi']
    after_roi = after_data['roi']
    
    roi_increase = after_roi - before_roi
    roi_percentage_increase = (roi_increase / before_roi) * 100
    
    return roi_percentage_increase

# Example data (before and after strategy)
before_data = {'roi': 10}
after_data = {'roi': 15}

roi_increase = track_roi_increase(before_data, after_data)
print(f"ROI Increase: {roi_increase}%")

Putting It All Together

You can integrate these features into a full-stack application, with a web interface built using Flask or Django, a frontend in React or Vue, and backend APIs to handle the Instagram data fetching, AI predictions, and review scraping.

    Backend (Flask/Django): Handle Instagram API, data analytics, and API endpoints for retrieving and displaying reviews.
    Frontend (React/Vue): Display user dashboards, brand ROI insights, and the reviews in a simple, easy-to-understand UI.

This is a high-level overview, and each feature can be expanded with additional functionalities as needed.
